pollution and noise: A geospatial\\nenvironmental justice analysis for Ghent, Belgium\\nThomas Verbeeka,b,⁎\\naDepartment of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom\\nbCentre for Mobility and Spatial Planning, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium\\nARTICLE INFO\\nKeywords:\\nAir pollutionNoiseEnvironmental inequality\\nEnvironmental justice\\nSpatial autocorrelationSpatial regressionABSTRACT\\nFollowing the growing empirical evidence on the health eﬀ ects of air pollution and noise, the fair distribution of\\nthese impacts receives increasing attention.', 'The existing environmental inequality studies often focus on a single\\nenvironmental impact, apply a limited range of covariates or do not correct for spatial autocorrelation.', 'This\\narticle presents a geospatial data analysis on Ghent (Belgium), combining residential exposure to air pollutionand noise with socioeconomic variables and housing variables.', 'The global results show that neighborhoods with\\nlower household incomes, more unemployment, more people of foreign origin, more rental houses, and higher\\nresidential mobility, are more exposed to air pollution, but not to noise.', 'Multiple regression models to explainexposure to air pollution show that residential mobility and percentage of rental houses are the strongest pre-\\ndictors, stressing the role of the housing market in explaining which people are most at risk.', 'Applying spatial\\nregression models leads to better models but reduces the importance of all covariates, leaving income andresidential mobility as the only signi ﬁcant predictors for air pollution exposure.', 'While traditional multiple re-\\ngression models were not signi ﬁcant for explaining noise exposure, spatial regression models were, and also\\nindicate the signi ﬁcant contribution of income to the model.', 'This means income is a robust predictor for both air\\npollution and noise exposure across the whole urban territory.', 'The results provide a good starting point fordiscussions about environmental justice and the need for policy action.', 'The study also underlines the importance\\nof taking spatial autocorrelation into account when analyzing environmental inequality.', 'Introduction\\nIn recent decades, the impact of the built environment on health and\\nwell-being receives increasing research interest ( Jackson, 2003).', 'Con-\\ncerns about levels of physical activity, respiratory disease, sleep dis-\\nturbance and stress strongly identify urban design and associated ac-\\ntivity patterns as a public health issue ( Dannenberg et al., 2012;\\nFrumkin, 2003).', 'Conclusive empirical evidence is available on the negative health\\nimpact of air pollution and noise.', 'Exposure to air pollution has beenrelated to asthma, de ﬁcits in lung development and allergy develop-\\nment in children; and a higher mortality and coronary disease risk forthe whole population ( Health Eﬀ ects Institute, 2010).', 'Recently, also\\neﬀects on cognitive performance and neuropsychological development,\\nespecially in children, have been established ( Suades-González, Gascon,\\nGuxens, & Sunyer, 2015 ).',

environmental equity considerations.', 'Keywords \\nHealth inequalities, noise nuisance, socio-economic factors, subjective health, urban health   Noise nuisance and health inequalities in Belgium: a population study 53 \\n \\nIntroduction \\nAccording to the World Health Organization (1), health risks are unfairly distributed in our so-\\nciety.', 'The most disadvantaged social groups (in terms of income, schooling or socio-\\neconomic group) are more exposed to health risks.', 'An international comparison of 11 Euro-\\npean countries revealed major social inequalities in subjective health.', 'These inequalities are also observed in mortality and morbidity rates (2).', 'Several lines of explanation have been explored: initially, these inequalities were put down to \\nindividual differences in harmful habits (smoking, alcohol consumption and poor diet), stress factors and psychosocial resources.', 'However, research indicated that the impact of harmful \\nhabits was relatively low (3)(4).', 'A second line of explanation took interest in contextual health \\nfactors, that is to say lifestyle characteristics, for individuals are not in fact randomly distrib-uted in space, and habitable space tends to be subject to socio-economic stratification.', 'This \\nsecond, lifestyle approach considers several aspects such as social capital, accessibility of \\npublic services and exposure to environmental risks (5).', 'In this study, we will be considering \\nan environmental factor that is rarely featured in studies of health inequalities, that is to say \\nexposure to noise pollution (6).', 'Vulnerable social groups are more likely to live in less favourable environments.', 'The litera-\\nture in this area has been mainly concerned with the role of air pollution, particularly because \\nthis may aggravate morbidity following allergies (7)(8)(9).', 'Up until now, very few researchers \\nhave examined the impact of noise pollution on these same inequalities.', 'According to Job (1996) there might be a causal link between exposure to noise pollution and bad health, al-\\nthough this link has not yet been definitively established.', 'The effects of noise pollution on \\nhealth may be the direct consequence of exposure to noise or may be attenuated by reac-tions to noise, such as annoyance or unhappiness (10).', 'One of the main difficulties in functioning engendered by noise pollution is the social handi-\\ncap that comes from the disturbance of oral language, the learning and/or understanding thereof.', 'This may result in changes in behaviour (aggression, hostility, selfishness) and/or life \\nhabits (increased consumption of drugs, medicines  or the number of medical consultations) \\n(10).', 'General fatigue may also be a source of difficulties in functioning.', 'This may have physiological, mental and social effects (11).', 'Lack \\nof sleep is a source of annoyance, stress and dissatisfaction (10), influencing performance \\nand mood (12).', 'Also, noise pollution can have a direct impact on morbidity of individuals by increasing the \\nrisks of hypertension (13) and ischemic cardiac conditions (14), and by changing the regula-\\ntion of stress hormones (15,16).', 'Most research undertaken to date has looked at the effects of noise in very specific contexts, \\nsuch as exposure to noise pollution in the workplace (17), alongside main roads (16) and in a \\nschool located close to an airport (18).', 'Few studies consider the effects of noise on subjective health.', 'Most research \\ndeals with objective health, difficulties in functioning or morbidity of individuals.', 'Yet it has \\nbeen established that the objective impact of noise pollution is only observable in the very long term.', 'Several studies suggest that physiological effects and health complaints are \\nclosely associated with subjective reactions to noise (19).', 'If one takes into account the nui-\\nsance felt by individuals and their subjective health, one can then take an earlier and more global approach to the problem.', 'Also, subjective  health is a major indicator of well-being and \\nperceived quality of life (20).', 'Finally, despite numerous studies into health inequalities, very \\nfew of these have been able to evaluate the extent to which noise pollution is a risk factor in health-related social inequalities.', 'Our aim is to study the contribution of noise pollution to health inequalities amongst the Bel-\\ngian population.', 'We will be investigating the contribution made by exposure to noise pollution in creating socio-economic inequalities in subjective health.', 'Methods \\nOur study is based upon an analysis of data from the most recent ‘general socio-economic \\nstudy of population and housing’ undertaken in Belgium in 2001 by the then National Institute \\nof Statistics (now DG Statistics).', 'The novelty  in this questionnaire, compared to previous \\nones, was the addition of several questions concerning the subjective health of individuals and the quality of the environment.', 'Belgium has followed the model in use in Britain since \\n1991, where it has been possible to link contextual data to data regarding the subjective \\nhealth of individuals.', 'This questionnaire was sent to all residents aged six and over.', 'DG Statistics contacted 9,631,313 individuals aged over six, \\n9,333,428 (or 97%) of whom returned their questionnaire.', 'The participation rate was very high, no doubt because this survey was instru cted by the Belgian legal system.', 'Questions on subjective \\nhealth (21) had a missing data rate of only 2.6%, which is relatively low.', 'In addition, there was no indication that this bias was greater when the respondents were elderly people.', 'In this case, we will work on a sample of a little more than ten per-\\ncent of the Belgian population (N = 1,002,343).', 'The questionnaires and data from this Belgian survey of 2001 are described in detail in a monograph of the socio-economic survey \\non health (22) and commented by Lorant et al.', '(2002) (23).', 'Very \\ngood, good, average, bad or very bad?’ In our analysis we modelled the probability of having \\nbad subjective health (28% of the population).', 'According to the literature, subjective health (24) is a global measure of health, in the sense of quality of life, integrating both individuals’ \\npast trajectories and their future expectations.', 'Noise nuisance and health inequalities in Belgium: a population study 55 \\n \\nSocio-economic status is measured using four variables: level of education \\n(high/medium/low), activity (employed/unempl oyed/inactive), property status (owner/tenant) \\nand type of housing (detached house/semi-detached or terraced house/apartment/other).', 'The socio-economic survey has one question regarding noise pollution: ‘How do you judge \\nthe immediate environment of where you live: the tranquillity (noise pollution)?', 'Very pleasant, \\nsatisfactory, unpleasant’.', 'However, this ex posure variable may be affected by character \\ntraits: research shows that individuals with low self-esteem tend to negatively evaluate their \\nenvironment (25).', 'In our analyses, \\nwe used a dissatisfaction average per neighbour hood (calculated using the entirety of the \\nsocio-economic survey).', 'This strategy avoids the link between perception of noise pollution \\nand subjective health being too affected by non- observed individual aspects (such as charac-\\nter traits).', 'The link between subjective health and noise pollution may also be affected by other selec-\\ntion biases.', 'For example, more often than not, the youngest populations, who are in better \\nhealth, live in urban areas and are therefore the most exposed to pollution.', 'Failure to check age means possibly underestimating the effects of noise pollution.', 'To measure the effect of \\nenvironmental pollution on subjective health, by checking other confusing factors, we used \\nmultiple logistical regressions: Model 1 st udies the link between socio-economic variables \\nand bad subjective health by checking age and gender, while Model 2 adds perceived noise \\npollution.', 'Our transversal study analysed the effect of noise pollution in the neighbourhood.', 'The ad-\\nministrative definition of neighbourhood is ‘statistical sector’; this is therefore a quite specific \\nentity in the Belgian classification.', 'A neighbourhood corresponds to 640 individuals, with a \\nstandard-deviation of 692.', 'One has to add 255 rural districts to this number.', 'They are considered as neighbourhoods and account for \\n14.9% of the Belgian population, with an average of 3,800 individuals per district.', 'Results \\nThe results in Table 1 show that the prevalence of bad subjective health increases with the \\nprevalence of noise pollution.', 'In neighbourhoods t hat are little affected by pollution (quintile \\n1), 21.5% of individuals display bad subjective health, whilst in the neighbourhoods that are the most affected by this pollution (quintile 5), 33.1% of individuals have bad subjective \\nhealth.', 'This link between collective perception of pollution and subjective health is confirmed \\nby the significant chi-square test ( χ² = 5515.9).', 'That said, the results presented in Table 1 do not display an impact of noise pollution on in-\\ndividuals’ health.', 'The role of noise pollution in health inequalities is investigated in Table 2.', 'Model 1, controlled only for age and gender, highlights socio-economic health inequalities \\nmeasured using four variables.', 'Non-working individuals have a higher risk of bad subjective \\nhealth than working individuals (OR=1.78).', 'Health inequalities were also observed in tenants 56 Schmit C, Lorant V.  \\n \\n(OR=1.53), individuals with poor schooling levels (OR=2.07) and those living in temporary

the individual’s neighbourhood.', 'Few changes are observed between these two models,  except for the ‘activity’ and ‘type of \\nhousing’ variables.', 'The risk of bad subjective health on the part of the unemployed reduces \\nslightly between Model 1 and Model 2 (from OR=2.27 to OR=2.12).', 'It would also appear that \\nthe worse the quality of housing occupied, the more individuals are exposed to noise pollu-tion.', 'The risk of bad health of people living in housing of the ‘other’ type reduces slightly, \\nfrom 1.65 (Model 1) to 1.54 (Model 2).', 'Also, when one takes into account exposure to noise pollution, the risk of bad subjective health of those living in apartments becomes practically identical to that of indi-\\nviduals living in detached houses (OR=1.02).', 'Noise pollution is greater in towns due to road-traffic density, proximity to airports and prob-\\nlems with neighbours.', 'Consequently, the results in Table 3 have been stratified by level of \\nurbanisation and the analysis focuses more on activity and type of housing.', 'This stratification \\nshows that the effect of noise pollution on the social inequalities of subjective health is greater in urban areas.', 'It is indeed in urban areas that exposure to noise pollution is greatest.', 'The risk of bad health linked to noise pollution is particularly high for the unemployed, with \\nthe OR changing from 2.20 (Model 1) to 2.03 (Model 2).', 'Still looking at urban areas, we see that health inequalities linked to type of housing are in part due to noise pollution.', 'For indi-\\nviduals living in apartments, a category that concerns most Brussels inhabitants, the risk of \\nbad subjective health reduces from 1.16 to 1.01  when checked for noise pollution (Model 2).', 'The same is true for those living in housing of the ‘other’ type, with the risk of bad health re-\\nducing from 1.88 (Model 1) to 1.65 (Model 2).', 'However, in rural areas, the degree of risk of \\nbad health due to

nuisance and health inequalities in Belgium: a population study 59 \\n \\nDiscussion \\nThis research has provided several major results.', 'Firstly, our analyses show that the more an \\nindividual is exposed to noise pollution in thei r environment and lifestyle, the more they dis-\\nplay bad subjective health.', 'Next, noise pollution contributes to an increase in socio-economic \\nhealth inequalities, mainly when socio-economic status is defined in relation to the labour \\nmarket or to the housing market.', 'Indeed, one observes a clear influence of the exposure to noise pollution on health inequalities linked to type of housing and activity.', 'Unemployed indi-\\nviduals and people living in modest housing have greater risk of bad subjective health, owing \\nto their exposure to noise pollution.', 'According to a study undertaken by Evans ( 24), exposure to ambient noise pollution, and \\nother environmental risks, is ‘hostile’ to health and well-being.', 'Socio-economic status is as-sociated with the quality of the environment; the poorest individuals live in poorer quality \\nneighbourhoods and are therefore more exposed to noise pollution.', 'Socio-economic health \\ninequalities are related to the variation in ex posure linked to the quality of the environment.', 'Again according to Evans (24), exposure to ambient noise levels may be associated with in-\\ndividuals’ incomes.', 'The stratification of results by type of urbanisation shows that the effect of noise pollution on \\nhealth-related social inequalities depends on environment and lifestyle.', 'This observation may \\nbe explained by several mechanisms: the objective level of noise pollution is greater in towns \\nthan in the other levels of urbanisation and/or the urban population is more sensitive to noise, such as that related to problems with neighbours.', 'Our study is limited by the variables used and the nature of our data.', 'The independent noise \\npollution variable is subjective, since it takes individuals’ perception into account.', 'The link between subjective perception and objective measurement of noise pollution is far from be-\\ning very strong.', 'In fact, based upon data provided by Bruxelles Environnement/Leefmilieu \\nBrussel, researchers have obtained a low correlation of only 0.28 between average preva-lence of noise complaints and the Lden-60 level, which corresponds to a percentage of \\nsurface exposed to noise, that is to say more than 60dB (26).', 'Individuals’ perception may be \\ninfluenced by other events; it does not reflect noise pollution in the real sense of the term.', 'However, we do not think that this is of a nature that would considerably affect our results.', 'Indeed, the fact that we based our analyses on a neighbourhood average increases the va-\\nlidity of these data.', 'In addition, perception of noise pollution better reflects the true sensitivity/discomfort felt by the individual.', 'Also, we do not have epidemiological data con-\\ncerning Belgians’ state of health; we are working with a subjective health variable.', 'Nevertheless, several previous studies have shown that subjective health is a good proxy for morbidity and mortality.', 'The cross-sectional nature of our data prevents us from being affirmative regarding the link \\nbetween socio-economic status, noise pollution and subjective health.', 'We know that both noise pollution and a disadvantaged socio-economic status have an influence on rates of bad 60 Schmit C, Lorant V.  \\n \\nhealth.', 'However, the link between noise pollution and a disadvantaged socio-economic \\nstatus can take two ways.', 'Firstly, noise pollution causes a degradation of socio-economic \\nstatus by attracting people who are more disadvantaged and doubtless in less good health to start with.', 'For example, housing situated close to main roads has lower rents and is inhab-\\nited by families with lower incomes.', 'Secondly, \\nsocio-economically disadvantaged environments are sources of noise pollution.', 'Reasons in-\\nclude higher population density and lack of investment on the part of the authorities in these \\nneighbourhoods (bad window insulation, etc.).', 'Conclusions \\nIn conclusion, we note that within the Belgian population there is an increasing monotonous \\neffect between noise pollution and bad health.', 'We also note that health inequalities linked to \\nsocio-economic status of individuals are in part reinforced by exposure to noise pollution.', 'Noise pollution explains certain health inequalities in terms of activity and type of housing.', 'Our results show that exposure to noise pollution plays a role in health inequalities.', 'In future, \\npublic environmental policies, particularly those linked to urban planning, should take princi-ples of social justice into account.', 'Acknowledgment \\nThis research received financial support from Belgian Science Policy as part

the \\nenvironment, using a digital integrating sound level meter \\nSLM (SVANTEK 971) which record the changes in noise \\nlevel on the basis of sound pressure.', 'The study covered \\nmetal, grain mills; and non-formal metal industries.', 'For \\neach source, three (3) samples were taken for sound \\npressure measurements making a total of fifteen (9 ) \\nsamples.', 'Additional sites were included for social study to \\nraise the requisite sample of workers.', 'The industries were \\nselected through literature review and discusions held with \\nofficers at DOSHS, that identified them as the leading \\nsources of industrial noise pollution.', 'The selected \\nindustries also constituted a wider geographical distribution \\nof industries and formed a major manufacturing segment in \\nthe industrial area of Nairobi.', 'Work-place Noise Measurement  \\nTo determine occupational noise levels, measurements \\nwere taken in the production section of the industries at the \\noperator’ station.', 'The microphone was held at a height of \\n(1.5) meters and at least 1m from reflecting surfaces for a \\nduration of 10 minutes for each of the three samples at (9-\\n10hrs), (12-13hrs) and (15-16hrs).', 'The sound meter \\nrecorded the A-weighted sound pressure levels for specific \\ntime intervals which  were downloaded onto the supervisor \\nsoftware on the PC and the readings taken.', 'The principal \\nnoise index was the L Aeq (the A-weighted equivalent \\ncontinuous level averaged over a specified time period) \\nwhich was a representative noise exposure level of the \\nindustry as indicated and used in the Kenyan law.', 'Three \\nsampling times selected in this study were based on the \\nprevious study (Tsai et al., 2009; Momammed et al., 2012).', 'The environmental noise measurement parameters used in \\nthis study were: L Aeq8-17;  the average noise level during the \\nmeasurement period (8-17hrs), which includes all noise \\nevents; L A90: the noise level exceeded for 90% of the time, \\ngeneral representative of the steady background noise at a \\nlocation, and; L APeak; peak sound level which is the \\nmaximum instantaneous sound level in dB(A).', 'Using the \\nspecific interval measurements for 8 hours from 8 to 17 \\nhours,  L Aeq8-17  was calculated for each noise source using \\nequation (1) in which L Aeq8-17  is the continuous equivalent \\nA-weighted noise pressure level from 8 to 17 hours; n is \\nthe number of 10 minutes measurements between 8.00 and \\n17.00 hours; LA eq(i/10)  is the A-weighted continuous noise \\npressure measurement in the one 10 minutes instant; i is the \\nfrequency of the measurement where i varies from 1 to n.

J. LANGDON \\nby slow running in low gears, stopping, starting and accelerating through the gears, and so on.', 'As against this, the more conditions approximate to free flow, particularly at traffic volumes \\nsufficient to generate noise nuisance, the less noticeable becomes the contribution from \\nheavy vehicles.', 'This trend is even more marked at higher speeds, typical of motorway con- \\nditions, for as speed increases, the noise emitted by petrol engine vehicles increases sharply \\nas compared with diesel engine vehicles [6].', 'Consequently, where more or less free flow conditions prevail, measured noise levels may \\nbe expected to correlate with residents’ experience of noise nuisance.', 'It may also be suggested \\nthat for the same reason, in free flow traffic the absolute number rather than the percentage of \\nheavy vehicles correlates well with dissatisfaction.', 'For in these conditions, the number of \\nheavy vehicles, like traffic volume, also co-varies with noise level.', 'In non-free flow conditions, \\noften associated with roads used above their design capacity, a measure based on traffic \\ncomposition yields better predictions since it represents more effectively the predominant \\nsource of nuisance within the dwelling.', 'Whether any of these speculations are confirmed or refuted-for which further studies \\nwould be needed-the fact remains that in densely populated areas where traffic noise is a \\nmajor source of nuisance, traffic conditions resembling those studied by the present survey \\ntend to be more typical than those described as free flow.', 'And in these circumstances the \\nfindings emphasize strongly the importance of heavy vehicles-as here defined-as major \\nsources of nuisance.', 'PREDICTION OF NOISE NUISANCE FOR ALL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS \\nThe division of the sample into two subsamples on the basis of traffic flow and arrival \\npattern was made to facilitate the subsequent analysis.', 'It is inevitable that any such sub- \\ndivision must be to some degree arbitrary, since in reality traffic conditions vary over a con- \\ntinuum extending from orderly free flowing traffic to completely disordered and congested \\nconditions.', 'A noise measure appropriate to either of these conditions should yield useful predictions \\nover a wide range of traffic situations without the need for precise specification of the nature \\nof the traffic pattern.', 'This requirement appears to be met, within the range of conditions \\ncovered by the survey, by a measure combining noise measured as L,, or L,,, and traffic \\ncomposition measured as log percentage of heavy vehicles.', 'Nevertheless, such a formula is \\nof necessity a compromise to give the best overall prediction for all conditions.', 'It follows that \\nthe effect of extreme conditions of free or non-free flows tend to lower the value for the \\nmultiple correlation since they are represented best by a single relevant parameter either of \\nnoise or traffic.', 'The combined measure therefore aims only to give a rough indication of \\nprobable nuisance, most applicable in situations which cannot be identified as distinctively \\nfree or non-free flow.', 'Where more accurate predictions are required, or the traffic pattern is \\nfairly clear and distinctive, simple noise or traffic measures will produce superior results.', 'It will be seen from Figure 2 that, for the non-free flow sample, the 10 sites counted \\nintensively in 1972 lie closest to the best fitting line, and the same may be seen from Figure 4 \\nfor the 18 intensively counted sites of the total sample.', 'Fisher’s z test [7] shows that the value \\nof r = 0.86 for the 18 sites is not significantly different from that of r = O-712 for all sites.', 'Nevertheless prediction is in fact better for the intensively counted sites since the same level \\nof significance is reached from data covering a smaller range of variation.', 'The 18 intensively counted sites cover the range from 12 to 32% heavy vehicles whereas \\nthe total sample of 53 sites extends this to 6 % heavy vehicles.', 'However, regression equations \\nfor the two sets of data do not yield notably different predictions: \\n53 sites : Diss.', '= 0*078L,, + 3.34 log ( % H.V.)', '- 4.5, (4) \\n18 sites : Diss.', '= O.O89L,, + 4.3 1 log ( % H.V.)', '(8) ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE NUISANCE, PART II 270 \\nThese relatively small differences suggest that the percentage of heavy vehicles is a compara- \\ntively robust parameter which is not too critically dependent upon 100% sampling.', 'At the \\nsame time, it would seem that intensive counting of traffic composition over the entire range \\nof sites would have resulted in a significant improvement in accuracy of prediction.', 'Although the combined measure yields useful predictions over a wide range of traffic \\nconditions, there remains the problem of how the expected effects of insulation or screening \\nof buildings can be predicted.', 'For the unit by which the effects of such procedures are evaluated \\nis not itself a wholly acoustic measure.', 'To facilitate such procedures it would seem that existing measurements of external noise \\nrequire to be supplemented to take account of the extra contribution made by heavy vehicles \\nto the internal noise level.', 'This would produce values in acoustic units in closer correspon- \\ndence with residents experience.', 'Such measures might initially be developed with the aid of \\ndata for external and internal noise levels obtained over a range of traffic composition and \\nflow.', 'This information would enable measurements of traffic composition to be transformed \\ninto acoustic quantities with which to supplement external noise measurements.', 'UNIFIED NOISE NUISANCE INDICES \\nIt was shown that in non-free flow conditions, L,, yielded correlations between measured \\nnoise levels and dissatisfaction marginally superior to those obtained from L,, or Leq, though \\nstill too low to provide practically useful predictions.', 'Optimising the value of k by multiple \\ncorrelation yielded a significant improvement in correlation for all traffic conditions, though \\nthe final value achieved for r is still below that needed for practical purposes.', 'However, the salient feature to emerge from this analysis is the finding that for the present \\nsample the “fluctuation” term plays no significant part in the correlation, and it is worthwhile \\nconsidering why this is so.', 'The failure to perceive this fact at an earlier stage is explained by the employment of \\n“ready made” values of LNP as a single term in a product-moment correlation.', 'Such a pro- \\ncedure obscures the separate contributions of the two components embodied in L,,.', 'Inspection of the data which determine the “fluctuation” term reveals that the reason why \\nthis term plays no part in the correlation is simply that the standard deviations of the instan- \\ntaneous level expressed as s are not large enough.', 'values range from 5.5 to 9-S and \\nare significantly related to equivalent noise level (r = 0.3: p = <O-05), the regression line \\npassing from 7.5 at 60 to 6.5 at 80 Leq, a magnitude and range of variation too small to affect \\nthe outcome.', 'Furthermore, the effectiveness of the second term is reduced by the additional circumstance \\nthat part of the fluctuation is accounted for by L,, itself.', 'This may be shown by performing \\nthe multiple correlation with values of L,, in place of L,,, with quite different results, as \\nshown by Table 12.', 'TABLE 12 \\nMultiple correlation of noise levels andjuctuations with group scores of

Table 10 shows that while correlation is not significantly \\nimproved, the partial correlation and t value for the second term are now both significant, \\nwhile k has a much larger value.', 'In this case, the “fluctuations” are playing a significant part \\nin the correlation, since their representation is now relegated wholely to the second term of 280 F. J. LANGDON \\nthe formula.', 'It is therefore perhaps legitimate to speculate whether this finding provides a \\npoint of departure for further study of complex noise nuisance indices, not structurally \\ndissimilar to LNP.', 'The magnitude of changes in instantaneous levels would expectedly be greater for noise \\nsources other than road traffic, such as railways and aircraft.', 'In such cases it would also be \\nexpected that the second term of L NP, or any related variant, would contribute significantly \\nto correlation with measured dissatisfaction.', 'Although offering no advantages over simpler \\nunits such as L,, or L,, in the case of road traffic noise, LNp therefore retains the potentialities \\nfor providing a single measure of nuisance from mixed or varied noise sources and merits \\ncontinued study.', 'The case of L,, appears somewhat different.', 'Like L,,, LDN also yields results as good as, \\nthough no better than, L,, from which it is derived.', 'Despite the 10 dB weighting of night noise \\nit yields identical predictions to L,,.', 'The reason for this is that although night noise levels \\nbetween 02.00 and 07.00 need not necessarily co-vary with daytime levels at the same sites, \\nfor the present sample of 53 sites they do so.', 'As a result, the effect of the weighting is merely \\nto increase the values of L,, by 10 x 9/24.', 'Thus for the present sample a regression line \\ngenerated from L,, is almost a perfect fit to that obtained from L,,.', 'A further point is that, as demonstrated in Part I of this paper [l, see section 5.21, principal \\ncomponent analysis of the dissatisfaction scale in terms of all activities disturbed by noise \\nshowed that disturbance of sleep does not contribute to the variance accounted for, a finding \\nin accord with that of Aubree [8].', 'As measured, general dissatisfaction is governed effectively \\nby what happens outside the hours of sleep.', 'Hence, so far as concerns traffic noise, LDN does not cause predictions of nuisance at any \\nparticular site to vary as compared with L,,, relative to those for any other site.', 'Nor would \\nsuch different predictions, had they occurred, relate to dissatisfaction measured by the overall \\n7-point scale.', 'This conclusion in no way diminishes the potential value of LDN as a unified noise nuisance \\nindex applicable to a wide range of different noise sources, though it does suggest that for road \\ntraffic noise L,, behaves no differently from L,, and other simpler measures.', 'SOURCES OF RESIDUAL VARIANCE \\nWhether the two subsamples or the total sample are being considered, choice of an appro- \\npriate indicator enables 60 to 70 % of group and a maximum of 10 % of individual variance \\nto be accounted for without introducing other factors such as the effects of perceived environ- \\nmental quality.', 'Nevertheless, although adequate predictions can be made for the community \\nthe proportion of individual variance in response accounted for by physical measures remains \\nsmall.', 'The limits to prediction do not appear to be set by the choice of physical parameter \\nbut arise mainly from the range of individual response.', 'This derives from a variety of sources \\nof which the most notable is differences in noise sensitivity.', 'Perhaps the first conclusion to be drawn from this is that further work to improve prediction \\naccuracy is likely to be unprofitable.', 'If a significantly greater proportion of variance can be \\naccounted for only by resort to such factors as sensitivity, etc.', 'For such factors, even if identified by research studies, cannot be measured at any \\ngiven location except by a social survey.', 'For practical noise control the only data available \\nare physical variables which can be directly measured or estimated, such as those described \\nin this paper.', 'Leaving aside the needs of practical nuisance prediction however, it is desirable to account \\nfor as much variance as possible, to identify the principal factors and to develop a coherent \\nand logically satisfying model of the noise nuisance relationship.', 'Space for this is lacking here \\nand such exhaustive analysis must be postponed to Part III of the report which will bring ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE NUISANCE, PART II 281 \\ntogether data related to individual differences arising from sensitivity, environment, social, \\neconomic and ethnic factors.', 'For the present it is sufficient to draw attention to the problems and complexities raised by \\nsensitivity to noise, the largest single source of variance in individual responses.', 'As measured by the self-rating schedule employed in the survey, sensitivity to noise gener- \\nates three separate sub-populations or groups.', 'Regression analysis applied to the dissatis- \\nfaction scores of each group generates two quite different pictures according to whether the \\nfree or non-free flow samples are being considered.', 'For the former, where noise level is the \\nphysical parameter, the sensitive and non-sensitive groups remain dissatisfied and satisfied \\nrespectively over the range of levels.', 'In non-free flow conditions, measured by the proportion of heavy vehicles, all three groups \\nshow a graded dissatisfaction response to increasingly adverse conditions, the non-sensitive \\nproducing the sharpest response.', 'First, for both subsamples, the three groups retain their relative \\npositions, the “sensitives” having the highest and the “non-sensitives” the lowest dissatis- \\nfaction scores on average for all noise levels or traffic conditions.', 'Second, the degrees of dis- \\npersion for the dissatisfaction scores of the three groups is such that in both conditions no \\ngreat significance can be attached to the relative slopes of the regression lines, particularly as \\nregards the non-free flow subsample.', 'It would therefore seem that to apply regression analysis \\nto this data is to push the technique beyond its limits.', 'Finally, there is the problem of whether replies to the self-rating schedule can be regarded \\nas affected by traffic conditions of the two subsamples, and whether the classification of sites \\nby the traffic composition parameter is dimensionally equivalent to classification by external \\nnoise levels.', 'These questions cannot be answered without resort to much detailed analysis \\nnot possible here and must be deferred to the final paper reporting the survey results.', 'CONCLUSIONS \\n(1) Where road traffic is disrupted by intersections, or by congestion, etc., so that free flow \\nconditions are not maintained, noise nuisance as reported by residents is not predicted \\naccurately by existing noise units such as L,, or L,,, measured externally.', 'While the trend \\nrelationships exhibited are highly significant they do not permit of nuisance prediction for a \\nparticular noise level, and the same applies to measures of traffic volumes.', '(2) A measure of traffic composition, the logarithm of the percentage of heavy vehicles in \\nthe traffic stream, yields more useful predictions of noise nuisance.', 'This measure accounts \\nfor nearly as much group variance as do measures based on noise levels employed in free flow \\nconditions, and a significantly greater proportion of individual variance.', '(3) Although the proportion of heavy vehicles appears to be a comparatively robust \\nmeasure which in most circumstances is not critically dependent on 100% time sampling, \\nnevertheless the data gathered in the course of the survey related only to the hours between \\n08.00 and 20.00.', 'Further work would be required to discover the effects of altering the times \\nor the periods for which traffic is counted.', '(4) It is suggested that the failure of existing noise measures to predict noise nuisance \\naccurately where traffic does not flow freely is related to the characteristics of heavy vehicles \\noperating in these conditions.', 'It seems probable that the felt incompatibility of such vehicles \\nin close proximity to the dwelling influences expressed dissatisfaction disproportionately to \\ntheir relative contribution to overall noise levels, and it is also likely that the difference between \\nnoise from heavy and light vehicles is further increased when the noise is heard within the \\ndwelling.', '(5) It is recognized that the subdivision into free and non-free flow conditions applied to the 282 F. J. LANGDON \\ntotal sample is to some extent arbitrary, in that actual traffic conditions form a continuum \\nfrom one extreme condition to the other.', 'It is suggested that as traffic conditions approach \\nthose described as free flow, noise nuisance is governed increasingly by noise levels as measured \\nexternally.', 'Correspondingly, as disordered and congested conditions tend to prevail the \\nrelevance of these measures declines, being progressively outweighed by a measure of the \\nproportion of heavy vehicles.', '(6) It is therefore suggested that noise nuisance occasioned by all road traffic conditions may \\nbe predicted, without prior classification of traffic, by means of a weighted combination of \\nexternally measured noise level and the proportion of heavy vehicles.', 'In this connection, an \\nequation employing as parameters the total traffic volume, the proportion of heavy vehicles, \\nand the street width from dwelling facade to far kerb accounts for more variance for groups \\nand for individual responses than any other measure studied.', '(7) In order to evaluate the likely effects of building insulation or engineering works in \\nreducing noise nuisance it is desirable to employ a nuisance measure utilizing purely acoustical \\nparameters.', 'In the light of the foregoing conclusions it is suggested that studies of the effect \\nof the built structure, and of the representativeness of A-weighted levels measured externally \\nfor noise nuisance in the dwelling are required.', 'Such work might lead to more effective \\nmeasures of noise nuisance.', 'ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nThe work described has been carried out as part of the research programme of the Building \\nResearch Establishment of the Department of the Environment and this paper is published \\nby permission of the Director.', 'B.

(“very much”, “rather”, “something”, “little” and \\n“nothing”).', 'To find possible correlations among the different degrees of \\nannoyance and environmental noise levels, numerical values have been \\nassigned to the above mentioned semantic scale (5, 4, 3, 2 and 1, respec- \\ntively).', 'The homogeneity of variances was proved by means of the Barlett \\ntest, since the size of the samples were not the same in the five urban zones \\nconsidered.', 'The correlation was calculated using five pairs of values: the nuisance \\nindices (calculated as the weighted response to the above questions in the five \\nzones) and the most usual global noise descriptors (calculated from the noise \\nlevel values measured in the five zones).', 'A number of different noise indices \\nwere considered.', 'The main data and results of this analysis are summarized \\nin Table 4.', 'It should be observed that the best correlation between general \\nnoise annoyance (first question) and sleep interference (second question) \\ncorresponds to the night-day equivalent sound level Ldn measured on \\nworking days.', 'In general, global noise indices measured in working days \\ncorrelate better than global

R957Noise pollution\\nHans Slabbekoorn\\nWhat is noise pollution?', 'Noise \\npollution refers to the elevation of natural ambient noise levels due to sound-generating human activities, which may have detrimental consequences for humans and animals alike (\\nFigure 1 ).', 'Sounds of \\nthis kind are often referred to as anthropogenic noise.', 'Some of these sounds are deliberate and wanted, such as music, sirens, seismic survey sounds or military sonar.', 'Most anthropogenic noise, however, is an unwanted by-product, such as trafﬁ  c or generator noise, and impulsive sounds from pile driving and explosives.', 'No, the \\nnatural world has always been ﬁ  lled with sound of abiotic origin, like wind, rain, thunder, waves, cracking ice, and rustling leaves.', 'Well known biotic sound examples include: singing and calling from birds, mammals, frogs and insects, but also echo-locating or splashing whales, food scraping reef ﬁ  shes or sea urchins, and snapping shrimps.', 'Depending on the animal \\nspecies, natural sounds may be biologically relevant acoustic signals and cues or irrelevant but potentially problematic background noise.', 'Sounds can be particularly important to animals when visibility is low, as in dense forest, underwater or in nocturnal conditions.', 'Animals may communicate with vocalizations to ﬁ  nd group members and potential mates, or to ﬁ  nd prey by passive acoustics or active echolocation.', 'They may also use sound to detect and escape predators or to ﬁ  nd their way to any resource or hiding place through so-called soundscape orientation.', 'What are the main sources of noise \\npollution?', 'The most prominent and  Quick guideof the 19th century and a considerable \\nacceleration in car production happened soon after World War II, in which period commercial aviation also started to grow rapidly.', 'Growth in noise pollution levels in the oceans roughly coincided with that in air, and was primarily related to the cold war increase of sonar use and the steady incline in global shipping activity associated with international trade.', 'Seismic exploration for geophysical surveys started about 90 years ago, while pile driving for wind turbines at sea in coastal areas is a recent growth sector of the last decade.', 'Humans \\nmay get direct or delayed hearing damage from acoustic overexposure and direct damage may be temporary or permanent, making someone more or less deaf for a while or forever.', 'More moderate levels of anthropogenic noise may cause annoyance, chronic stress, sleep disturbance, decreased speech intelligibility, slow-down of cognitive development, performance decline in precision work, delayed wound healing, and even increased probability of heart failure (\\nFigure 2 ).', 'Animals \\nmay also get hearing damage by acoustic overexposure, with temporary or permanent auditory widespread (spatially and temporally) \\nsources of anthropogenic noise are trafﬁ  c of all sorts: cars, trucks, planes and vessels.', 'Examples of locally intense and more short-term or repetitive sound sources are explosions, pile driving, seismic surveys, and military sonar.', 'Examples of more moderate but also more long-term and lasting sound sources are highway trafﬁ  c, ferry lines, shipping lanes, industrial generators, busy airports, construction sites, motorized recreation, air conditioners, cleaning machines, dredging, and pumping systems.', 'The impact of people \\non natural soundscapes must have grown gradually with the human population growth on earth and the use of stones and metal for construction and tool making in the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages.', 'High-intensity anthropogenic sound events may have emerged with the invention of gunpowder in China, in the 9\\nth century, used for mining, \\nwarfare and demolition.', 'However, the invention of the steam engine, and the industrial revolution in general, by the end of the 18\\nth century, can be \\nregarded as the real start of steady growth of industrial and trafﬁ  c noise in the western world.', 'The automotive industry rose in the USA by the end \\nFigure 1.', 'Anthropogenic noise affects birds and ﬁ  shes.', 'Birds in cities, along highways and around airports are exposed to a variable degree of more or less \\nﬂ uctuating sound levels.', 'They are reported to sing at higher amplitude and higher frequency than rural \\ncongeners by which they alleviate masking problems at noisy times and places.', 'Still, avian diversity and density are detrimentally affected by noise pollution and there seems to be more impact on low- than on high-frequency singers.', 'Shipping lanes and motorized recreation also make the underwater world noisy.', 'Boat sounds from the engine and propeller-generated cavitation can disturb spawning ﬁ shes, cause physiological stress, deter schools to deeper water, or delay migratory journeys.', 'Great \\ntit by Herman Berkhoudt and London background by Philip Greenspun, used

organ ruptures and internal bleeding, as reported for aquatic animals.', 'Behavioural responses can also be fatal in the case of strandings of marine mammals.', 'Other behavioural effects of anthropogenic noise include disturbance and deterrence, but also masking and distraction, which may have relatively subtle consequences for individuals, but potentially concerns large numbers of animals and species (\\nFigure 2 ).', 'Anthropogenic sounds as \\nwell as natural ambient conditions vary in level, spectrum and temporal patterns.', 'As mentioned above, super intense sounds are most likely to cause physical damage, even after brief overexposure, although the duration of exposure will add to the probability of impact.', 'Sudden and irregularly repeated sounds, or sounds particularly contrasting \\nwith the acoustic background and locally unfamiliar, have especially high potential to deter, disturb, and distract.', 'These kinds of problems will be less when natural ambient conditions are already noisy, such as in turbulent weather or during periods of chorusing by large numbers of animals.', 'For the same reason, more continuous anthropogenic sounds, overlapping in spectrum and in time with acoustic signals and cues, have the most potential to mask natural sounds, for example interfering with animal communication.', 'No, animals do not necessarily \\nhear what humans do and there is much taxonomic variation in what frequencies different species are able to hear.', 'Humans hear sounds of between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, with highest sensitivity between 1 and 6 kHz.', 'Most birds have a similar frequency range as humans, except for often lower sensitivity in the upper \\nhalf of the range.', 'Carnivores, like dogs and cats, have high sensitivity up to 30 or 40 kHz, while there are bat species with good sensitivity up to 100 kHz.', 'Rodents, like mice and rats, also hear well in high frequencies like carnivores, but hear less well below 20 kHz, and hear even badly below 2 kHz.', 'Most invertebrates and ﬁ  shes are only sensitive to low frequencies, some starting around 10 Hz, up to 1 kHz, or exceptionally up to 4 kHz or higher.', 'Marine mammals vary extensively, with large baleen whales being sensitive to very low frequencies (10 Hz to 10 kHz) and smaller dolphins being sensitive to very high frequencies (3 kHz to 160 kHz).', 'Yes, it does matter what \\nanimals hear, as sounds that remain undetected will not deter, disturb, or distract and detrimental signal-to-noise ratios cannot lead to masking if signals would not have been heard anyway.', 'As most anthropogenic noise is biased to low frequencies (below 2 kHz), it is expected to have an impact on humans and birds, and especially on invertebrates, fishes and baleen whales.', 'Rodents and bats in air and dolphins in water will be less likely to have problems with most sources of noise pollution.', 'However, even when anthropogenic noise is just audible, there may still be a behavioural effect.', 'Furthermore, we sometimes also generate exceptionally high-frequency sounds, such as with some types of light sources, monitors, or military sonar.', 'These sounds can bother mice or dolphins, while inaudible to us.', 'Sound-induced \\ndeterrence, disturbance and distraction may fade due to habituation to continuous or repeated exposure.', 'Animals may exhibit fading responsiveness to the same sound of the same intensity in case such sounds are not associated with some direct negative consequences.', 'Animals may even also learn to associate initially frightening sounds with positive experiences and may become acoustically attracted.', 'Diverse effects of noise pollution.', 'Potential effects of noise pollution on humans and animals in air and in water vary with sound level, duration, spectrum, temporal pattern, and distance from the source.', 'Exposure to the most intense sound close to the source (in red) can cause physical damage to the auditory system and rupture organs or blood vessels.', 'The behavioural or physiological consequences for individual animals to more moderate sounds at larger distances (in yellow and orange) may seem less dra-matic, but they are more widespread and affect many more species and individual animals.', 'Ap-parently subtle changes in the acoustic climate may, therefore, have the potential to accumulate to population-level problems or ecosystem shifts.Current Biology\\nMagazine\\nCurrent Biology 29, R942–R995, October 7, 2019 R959Dolphins may, for example, approach \\nso-called pingers at ﬁ  shing nets, which are designed to deter, but having potential to become a dinner bell.', 'Animals can also become skilled in extracting biologically relevant sounds from a familiar background of irrelevant sounds.', 'Yes, there are many \\nexamples in which acoustically communicating animals adjust their vocal signals under noisy conditions, which often makes them better audible.', 'Primates, bats, birds, frogs and ﬁ  shes have all been reported to sing or call louder under more noisy conditions, as we do when raising our voice when a party becomes noisy.', 'Many animal species (and humans) are also reported to respond to noise by raising the frequency of the sounds they make, as in the case of urban birds which famously sing higher at times or in neighbourhoods with elevated levels of low-frequency trafﬁ  c noise.', 'Finally, animals may also repeat more often or adjust timing of their vocal activity such that its overlap with masking noise is reduced.', 'In contrast to signals that serve senders and receivers in communication, biologically relevant cues from prey or other resources are obviously not adjusted to the ﬂ  uctuating noise levels to accommodate receivers.', 'Birds and frogs in \\nparticular have been found to be negatively affected in their distribution patterns by noise pollution.', 'Lower diversity and density near noisy highways, airports, or generators at gas extraction stations clearly indicate noise-determined habitat reduction.', 'Sound contributes to the detrimental effects of roads and cities on wildlife, next to and often beyond the range of other factors such as chemical pollution, altered vegetation, artiﬁ  cial lightning, collision and disturbance by human presence.', 'Animals may avoid noisy areas, but for various bird species there is also evidence \\nfor noise-dependent reduction in breeding success.', 'Terrestrial mammal species are also reported to avoid noisy areas and often become more nocturnal.', 'There are also species that remain unaffected and persist in noisy areas or even beneﬁ  t from the noise-dependent disappearance of competitors or predators.', 'Intriguingly, not only can predator–prey interactions shift due to noise pollution, but effects on seed dispersers and seed predators can even cause noise-dependent patterns in vegetation.', 'Long-term, \\nnoise-dependent distribution patterns are more difﬁ  cult to assess in marine systems.', 'Short-term deterrence of ﬁ  shes and marine mammals have been reported from areas exposed to seismic survey sounds, pile driving activities, and explosions.', 'The same species can be seen back hours, days, or weeks after the impact.', 'It is typically unclear, however, whether these are the same or other individuals and whether there are any detrimental consequences from missed foraging or spawning opportunities, or increased risk of predation or larger energy expenditure.', 'Also invertebrates, such as octopuses, crabs, lobsters, barnacles, molluscs and jellyﬁ  sh are known to respond with behavioural and physiological changes to experimental sound exposure, while pelagic larvae across taxa are guided by acoustic cues for settlement in appropriate habitat.', 'Consequently, the widespread nature of noise pollution may cause shifts at the bottom of the food chain, with potential for trophic cascades.', 'Marine mammals seem especially vulnerable to acoustic disturbance in case of mother–calf pairs, for which splitting up may be fatal.', 'For some species, such as elephant seals (Mirounga leonina ), rare empirical \\ndata are used to show population level effects through so-called \\nPopulation Consequences of Acoustic Disturbance (PCAD) models.', 'These PCAD models translate behavioural and physiological disturbance into individual vital rates of growth, maturation, survival and reproduction, which accumulate to predictions about effects for the population.', 'The results indicate that persistent disturbance by noise can have long-term effects contributing to population decline.', 'It is clear for many \\nspecies that noise pollution can cause changes in behaviour or induce physiological stress.', 'This could translate into consequences for survival and reproduction, but has been explored for only very few species.', 'Furthermore, lowered ﬁ  tness for individuals has the potential to yield population consequences, but this is even less explored, often lacking sufﬁ  cient empirical data.', 'If these translation steps from behaviour and physiology to vital rates to population consequences were to be completed for a particular species, dynamic processes at the ecosystem level remain to be investigated.', 'Effects of noise pollution go beyond single species, may affect predator–prey interactions, and may work their way up the trophic levels of ecological food webs.', 'However, only few studies have been done and only recently has our awareness been raised about the potential for this ecosystem impact.', 'Due to the global \\nnature of spread and taxonomically wide impact of noise pollution, it seems indeed reasonable to speak about acoustic climate change.', 'However, animals are often exposed to multiple noisy activities at the same time or in sequence, potentially in parallel with other disturbing factors such as changes in temperature regimes, drought, salinity, or invasive species.', 'Investigating cumulative effects of Current Biology\\nMagazine\\nR960  Current Biology 29, R942–R995, October 7, 2019 © 2019 Published by Elsevier

weight.', 'Unlike the Dutch environ-\\nmental noise burden of disease study, hypertension based mortality is not included in the analysis to avoid overestimation.', 'Moreover, hypertension and IHD are not only attributable to noise exposure, and cannot be studied independently of other\\nsources like stress, way of life, and genetics.', 'Additionally, the calculated DALYs are not equal to the avoidable number of DALYs.', 'If one cause can be eliminated, the morbidity reduction might not occur because competitive risks are not taken into account.', 'Because of the uncertainty about the relationship, sleep disturbance due to aircraft is not taken into account although the\\nproblem is real in a densely populated region like Flanders.', 'Also the DALYs of annoyance due to air trafﬁc are incomplete\\nbecause only the area around Brussels National Airport is taken into account, areas around regional airports like Antwerp\\nand Ostend are excluded.', 'The limitation to four health and well-being effects examined means the overall effect of noise\\non public health is underestimated.', 'The DALY uncertainty range related to annoyance and sleep disturbance is mainly due to the different disability weights\\navailable and the different methodologies to calculate prevalence.', 'The DALY range related to IHD and hypertension is inﬂu-\\nenced by multiple factors.', 'First, in this study the assumption is made that people suffering from ischemic heart disease or\\nhypertension do not recover and will suffer from it throughout the year.', 'Second, the assumption is made that the exposure–response relationships of van Kempen et al.', 'are applica-\\nble to the Flemish situation.', 'Third, Ldenexposure values are used according to the European Directive on

(such as air-conditioning noise), they are referred to as broadband.', 'On the other hand, a single note, or tone, would be referred to as narrow-band.', 'Human perception of loudness is highly

patients are treated or observed and no more than 30 dBA in ward rooms [10], although a recent landmark study showed that no hospital noise results published since 1960 meet these guidelines [7].', 'The noise normally occurring inside rooms is often \\nreferred to as “background noise.” In hospitals, back -\\nground noise can result from a variety of sources includ -\\ning air-conditioning systems, medical devices such as respirators, and occupant sounds such as conversation.', 'Impulsive noises, or very loud, short duration events, are also commonly found in hospitals (eg, doors

frequency whereas the energy in pink noise changes with frequency.', 'Both types of noises sound simi -\\nlar to TV or radio static (ie, turned on but not tuned to a station).', 'Another important measure of sound in rooms is reverberation time (RT).', 'It is related to volume and absorption; generally larger spaces with less absorption (harder, reflective sur -\\nfaces) have longer RTs.',

experiments involving sleep disturbance, researchers have often fo -\\ncused on disturbances that occur within 3 seconds of a measurable increase in noise, eg, greater than 10 to 15 decibels (dBA).', 'As early as 1976, investigators studied how the qual -\\nity and quantity of sleep in a respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) was affected by noise [14].', 'Ten patients were monitored using PSG,

cycle.', 'This study described an average normal night’s sleep as consisting of 4 to 5 sleep cycles, with each cycle lasting 90 to 120 minutes.', 'The study concluded that patients would have difficulty sleeping normally due to interruptions such as noise caused by personal and environmental noises.', 'Aurell and Elmqvist studied 9 subjects in a postoperative ICU using PSG, EEG, and interviews [13].', 'A reduction of environmental noise was also made to compare a quiet environment to the noisy environment.', 'The degree of change was unreported, but with these acoustical alterations all 9 subjects experienced sleep deficiencies.', 'Topf et al studied the interaction between noise and \\nthe suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with a sample of 70 women, comparing quiet conditions with noisy conditions [16].', 'Approximately one-quarter of sleep time is normally spent in REM, which consists of episodic bursts of rapid eye movements along with heart rate, respiration irregularities, and paralysis of major muscle groups other than some respiratory muscles [15].', 'REM sleep is believed to help with cognitive factors such as memory retention and learning capabilities.', 'Although the Topf et al study took place in a sleep lab, the subjects were exposed to a recording of nighttime coronary care unit (CCU) noise at 84 dB [16].', 'Noise affected the quality of REM sleep compared to patients in quiet con -\\nditions; specifically, the subjects exposed to noisy CCU sounds experienced shorter REM periods and less REM activity.', 'The authors

3 seconds’ duration, oc -\\ncurring following at least 30 seconds of sleep [18].', 'This study took place in an intermediate respiratory care unit and utilized 24-hour PSG measurements.', 'Although this study only had a sample size of 6 subjects, the research -\\ners concluded that noise peaks greater than 80 dB(A) can correlate to sleep arousals.', 'The authors noted that follow-up studies were needed to identify the sources of the noise peaks.', 'Freedman et al used a larger sample size of 22 patients in a medical ICU where 20 of the patients were mechanically ventilated [19].', 'The mean noise level was measured as 59.1 dBA in the day and 56.8 dBA at night.', 'They found that environmental noise was not the main reason for sleep fragmentation, but noise was partially responsible.', 'Specifically, 11.5 and 17% of the total arousals and awakenings were related to noise, re -\\nspectively.', 'The exact sources of noise were not described.', 'There has also been investigation into whether the \\ndifferences between peak and average background noise levels are important.', 'Subjects were exposed to recorded sounds from an ICU that included patient-staff interactions, alarms, ventilators, equipment noise, and others.', 'The average level of the ICU noise-only was 57.9 dB and the combined ICU and white noise was 61.1 dB.', 'The addition of white noise lowered the number of sleep arousals caused by ICU noise even though the average noise level increased.', 'Another study compared the different contributions \\nof ICU noise and patient-care activity noise to sleep dis -\\nruption [21].', 'Six healthy male patients and 7 mechanical -\\nly ventilated male patients were studied using a 24-hour PSG and a structured questionnaire was administered to the healthy subjects.', 'The patient population was already admitted to an ICU, whereas the healthy population con -\\nsisted of subjects who volunteered to spend a 24-hour pe -\\nriod in an ICU.', 'For the mechanically ventilated subjects, the average daytime and nighttime noise levels were 56.2 and 53.9 dB, respectively.', 'For the healthy subjects in an open ICU, the average daytime and nighttime levels were 55.6 and 51.4 dB, respectively.', 'For the healthy subjects in a single room, the average daytime and nighttime levels were 44.3 and 43.2 dB, respectively.', 'Results showed ICU noises and patient-care activities accounted for less than 30% of the sleep disruptions.', 'The remaining arousals and awakenings were caused by opening and closing the ICU main door, which was located near the patients.', 'The patients generally slept worse, meaning they generally exhibited more awakenings and arousals per hour and a shorter sleep time as compared to the healthy subjects.', 'For example, patients slept an average of 6.2 hours total, whereas healthy subjects slept an average of 8.2 to 9.5 hours total depending on if they were in an open bed location or a single room.', 'They also determined that about half of the patient’s sleep occurred during the day.', 'Questionnaire-only studies have also analyzed the \\nrelationships between noise and sleep disturbances in lieu of direct physiological measurements.', 'Topf et al exposed 60 females to an 8-hour audiotape of coronary care unit (CCU) noise from monitoring devices, ventilators, suc -\\ntion machines, drains, oscilloscopes, and staff [22].', 'The subjects reported a general negative impact on sleep, in -\\ncluding longer time to fall asleep, more awakenings, and fewer hours sleeping.', 'Another survey of 50 general ICU patients used the Intensive Care Unit Environmental Stressor Scale (ICUESS) and revealed that high stress -\\nors such as pain and noise were also factors in patients’ inability to sleep [23].', 'Another study of 203 patients revealed that patients felt their sleep was significantly worse in an ICU than at home [24].', 'Specifically, staff communication and alarms were the most disruptive to sleep, whereas telephones, televisions, beepers, and equip -\\nment noise were not as disruptive.', 'Dlin et \\nal observed ICU patients and recorded interruptions to sleep [25].', 'All but 3 of the patients in the ICU partici -\\npated, although specific sample size was not given.', 'Pa -\\ntients were interviewed and asked about sleeping patterns at home, in previous hospitalizations, and in the current hospitalization.', 'Additionally, staff members observed the patients as “frequently as possible” without structured questioning, and one final staff observation following release from the ICU.', 'Each staff observation consisted of logging interruptions such as discrete events which impacted the patient in a direct manner (such as the tak -\\nCLiniCaL review4

to sleep was activity and noise.', 'Monson and Edéll-Gustafsson implemented vari -\\nous changes in a neuro-ICU including noise-reducing medical and nursing routines and afternoon and night non-disturbance periods [26].', 'The total number of sleep disturbance factors over a one-week span before the behavioral modification program averaged 194.3 sleep disturbances, as compared to 162.1 after.', 'Another pro -\\ngram by Walder et al implemented 5 guidelines includ -\\ning systematic closure of doors, a reduction of intensity of alarms, efforts for low conversation, and coordination and limitation of nursing interventions in sleeping hours [27].', 'Results showed a lowering of average and peak noise levels after the changes, but reported that sleep patterns could still be disrupted.', 'A similar study by Kahn et al attempted to reduce peak noise sources in both medical and respiratory ICUs [28].', 'An observer was present in the measurements to note the noise sources.', 'They recorded noises such as HVAC, medical equipment, televisions, telephones, intercoms, beepers, and conversa -\\ntions.', 'The mean peak levels were 80.0 and 78.1 dBA, before and after behavioral modification, respectively.', 'There was significant reduction in the total number of peaks exceeding 80 dBA, from 1363 periods out of 2880 possible periods to 976 periods out of 2811 possible pe -\\nriods.', 'Specifically, between 6 am and 12 am, there was a significant reduction of noise peaks exceeding 80 dBA.', 'The authors suggested that sleep can be improved due to this reduction of noise peaks, but they left the topic for a future study.', 'Studies show that factors of the acoustic environ -\\nment besides noise can correlate to sleep disruption.', 'For example, sleep has been related to reverberation time (RT).', 'A study by Berg, which took place in a re -\\nfurbished former surgical ward, focused on the effects of RT on noise-induced sleep arousals using EEG for 12 subjects [29].', 'RT was reduced by an average 26% after the installation of sound absorptive ceiling tiles.', 'Noise ranged from 27 to 58 dB(A), coming from both continuous and impulsive sources such as dropped plates, traffic noise, fan noise, machine noise, doors closing, and radios.', 'Results showed that the installation of the sound absorptive ceiling tiles did not significantly change noise levels, but did significantly reduce the number of sleep arousals.carDiovascular respoNse\\nCardiovascular response is also related to the acousti -\\ncal environment [30–36].', 'Some of the earliest stud -\\nies revealed that heart rate, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular measures can be affected by noise.', 'Falk et al studied the relationship between vasoconstriction and noise intensity and bandwidth [31].', 'At noise levels greater than 70 dB there exists a linear relationship between increases of noise intensity and increases in va -\\nsoconstriction.', 'Further, an exposure to 90 dB of white noise could cause an immediate vasoconstriction with a recovery time of about 25 minutes after the white noise was turned off.', 'The severity of vasoconstriction was a function of bandwidth of the noise—as the bandwidth increases, the vasoconstriction worsens.', 'Conn related heart rate, frequency of arrhythmias, and \\nstate of anxiety during quiet and noisy periods in a coro -\\nnary care unit (CCU) [32].', 'Twenty-five male patients were exposed to 1-minute noise recordings between 3 to 4 pm and 7 to 8 pm.', 'The results showed that anxiety was heightened and the number of ventricular arrhythmias rose significantly during the “noisy” periods, defined to be periods of noise greater than 55 dB.', 'Further research has related changes in heart rate \\nwith types of noise source.', 'One study found that the average heart rate increased due to the presence of human sounds (talking) [33].', 'Another study of 28 patients in a surgical ICU showed an increase in heart rate due to talking inside a patient’s room [34].', 'The average noise levels ranged from 49.1 to 68.6 dBA.', 'When there were noise events that caused an increase of 3 dBA or greater in overall noise level, 89% of the tests showed an increase in heart rate more frequently than a decrease in heart rate.', 'For 46% of the tests, this increase was statistically significant.', 'When sound pressure levels showed a 6 dBA increase, the heart rate also rose from two to twelve beats per minute.', 'Additionally, heart rate significantly increased for impulse noise.', 'A similar study compared ambient stressors of equipment sounds to social stressors like conversation in a CCU [35].', '55% of the hospital noise was conversation in the room, 20% of the noise originated from background sound, 15% from hall conversation, and 10% from envi -\\nronmental sound.', 'Although noise did not significantly affect blood pressure, heart rate was elevated during social stressor conversations compared to quiet ambi -\\nent conditions.', 'Similar to the sleep study with variable acoustics \\ndescribed earlier [29], Hagerman et al examined blood pressure and heart rate in a “good” and “bad” acousti -\\ncal environment [36].', 'Absorptive acoustical ceil -\\ning tiles were added that decreased reverberation time by 50% in the main work area and by 56% in the patient rooms.', 'Also, the absorption decreased overall noise levels by 5 to 6 dB in the patient rooms.', 'Even though there was no significant difference across the entire group in heart rate, blood pressure, or pulse amplitude, there were significant differences when analyzing the data by type of disease.', 'Pulse amplitude is the difference between sys -\\ntolic and diastolic blood pressure [36].', 'In acute myocar -\\ndial infarction and unstable angina pectoris groups, the heart pulse amplitude was higher with the “bad” (ie, less absorptive) acoustical setting at night.', 'Additionally, pa -\\ntients in the “bad” acoustic setting were re-hospitalized more frequently at 1- and 3-month follow-up.', 'Gastric activity\\nEffects of noise on gastric activity are somewhat unclear.', 'Sonnenberg et al examined the link between cardio -\\nvascular response, mental stress, gastric acid secretion, and noise [37].', 'One phase tested 10 male subjects and exposed them to 90 dBA of broadband noise for 1 hour.', 'Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were mea -\\nsured.', 'The second phase tested the gastric response of 14 male subjects after exposing them to 90 dBA of broad -\\nband noise and a gastric stimulation.', 'Results showed that both diastolic and systolic blood pressure increased by 4 and 8 mm Hg, but heart rate and respiratory rate were not affected.', 'However, the noise did not affect gastric acid secretion.', 'Another experiment where 50 dyspeptic subjects were exposed to 95 dB pink noise for 15 minutes also showed no relationship between gastric secretion and noise [38].', 'Erckenbrecht that found that noise significantly increased small bowel transit time, stool frequency, and stool volume [37].', 'In another study [39] 21 male subjects were exposed \\nto a 110-minute recording that simulated different noise sources—hospital noise at 87.4 dBA, conversation at 91.3 dBA, and traffic at 85.6 dBA.', 'Gastric activity was studied via gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA), which controls stomach motility.', 'GMA was measured via an electro -gastrogram (EGG) using standard electrocardiogram (EKG) electrodes on the upper

'However, short-term noise exposure did cause an alteration of the superoxide anion and interleukin-1 secretion of neutro -\\nphils and macrophages, thus decreasing wound healing.', 'Wysocki measured wound surface area and found \\nthat the wounds healed slower in a group of rats ex -\\nposed to random white noise at 85 dB [41].', 'Additionally, the average weight of the exposed group of rats was lower even though food intake was the same between the exposed and unexposed group.', 'In another study, 119 mice exposed to temperature and noise stressors were inflicted with a small wound [41].',

measured by 2 methods:  size reduc -\\ntion of the wound and weight of the suprarenal gland.', 'The rats were exposed to combined environmental stressors that included flashes of light, a ringing bell, and scraping metal wheels.', 'Within the male group, the average difference in total healing was about 8 days.', '7  www.jcomjournal.com\\nNoise PollutioNotHer respoNses\\nOnly one study relates

was lon -\\nger for patients during the louder construction periods, with average length increasing about 1 day.', 'Only one study links hospital noise to patient pain \\nmanagement [45].', 'The range of noise levels was related to the number of patients requiring pain medication, such as narcotics, in a 10-bed recovery room.', 'Results showed an increase in noise was related to an increase in pain medication.', 'On the other hand, noise can poten -\\ntially be used into reduce pain sensations in certain cases.', 'The pa -\\ntients wore earphones and they were able to adjust the level of either orchestral music or white noise, noting that the white noise sounded similar to a waterfall.', 'Sixty-five percent of the patients were able to use this audio-analge -\\nsic effectively for procedures that usually elicit the use of nitrous oxide or local anesthesia.', 'The authors theorized that the music and white noise acted as analgesics due to their relaxing, soothing nature and because they masked sounds of dental drills, therefore reducing patient anxiety during procedures.', 'DiscussioN of results\\nIt is clear from this literature review that hospital noise is a serious issue potentially linked to several types of negative reactions in patients.', 'Table 1  summarizes the \\nstudies described in this review by author and outcome.', 'Patient sleep has been shown to be negatively af -\\nfected by the sound environment.', 'A number of research methods, including PSG, EEG, patient questionnaires, and observational studies have confirmed relationships between noise and sleep length, quantity, or quality.', 'The occurrence rate of sleep arousals tends to rise with exposure to heightened background or peak levels.', 'There have been many studies conducted on the number of noise-induced sleep arousals within different sleep stages.', 'Previous studies have also determined which noise sources, such as staff talking and telephone noise, arouse the patients most frequently and these sources typically become the targets for noise reduction programs.', 'One of the major concerns with these studies is that gener -\\nally small sample sizes are used in the initial experiments (eg, as few as 5 patients); thus, the applicability of these results to larger populations must be scrutinized.', 'Cardiovascular response has been related to noise \\nexposure.', 'Occurrences of vasoconstriction and increases in heart rate and blood pressure due to the presence of acoustical stimuli have been shown.', 'Additionally, anxiety and arrhythmia episodes are more frequent in noisy scenarios.', '7  July 2012    JCOM   7\\npotentially help offset the levels of noise and reduce the \\nnegative effects of noise on heart pulse amplitude and in -\\ncidence of re-hospitalization.', 'However, as a whole, results are not entirely consistent, with some studies showing changes and others not.', 'Additionally, it is not yet known in general whether the presence of noise is directly linked to the onset of heart disease or other chronic cardiovas -\\ncular problems.', 'For \\nexample, there are no known studies of noise and wound healing in humans.', 'Relationships between noise and pain management are also unclear.', 'The studies that do exist suggest the presence of noise may increase the need for pain medication but conversely, patient control over sound can potentially limit the need for certain medica -\\ntions.', 'The field of music therapy is ripe with evidence suggesting the benefits of pleasing sounds, but was not the focus of this literature review.', 'Rigorous studies are needed to relate noise to wound healing and pain.', 'The literature taken as a whole can be organized in \\na way that studies the entire research chain: from the acoustic metrics being tested through the mechanism being introduced to the occupant outcomes.', 'For ex -\\nample, Berg [29] focused on how a change in reverbera -\\ntion time affects patient sleep; thus the acoustic metric is reverberation time, the mechanism is the addition of absorptive tiles, and the occupant outcome is the change in patient sleep arousals.', 'The occupant outcomes shown in Table 2 were generally negative when the subjects were exposed to noise, ie, sleep quality was reduced, cardio -\\nvascular response was heightened, and healing rates were lowered.', 'When environmental changes or behavioral changes were made to reduce noise or reverberation time, the outcomes were generally positive.', 'It is important to note in Table 2 under the “Metric” \\ncolumn several studies show blank acoustic metrics.', 'This does not mean that acoustics were not considered in the studies; rather, it reveals that specific acoustic metrics were not systematically altered.', 'For example, in Carley et al [17], 85 dB tones were used in the study for noise exposures.', 'A change in decibel value was not specifically studied; instead, it is the exposure to noise that was of interest.', 'Alternatively, in the Hagerman study [36], the acoustic metric that was altered and controlled for was reverberation time (value reduced by 50%–56%).', 'Hence, the Hagerman study [36] systematically altered reverberation time, as opposed to Carley et al [17] that drew their conclusion from the exposure itself, not from an acoustic metric.', 'coNclusioNs\\nThis review reveals that hospital noise is a serious issue linked to several potential negative reactions in patients.', 'The clinical significance of these results is not entirely known, but some hypotheses are possible.', 'Sleep is fundamental to human health in general and critical to patient recovery.', 'Alertness, mood, behavior, coping abilities, respiratory muscle function, ventilatory control, healing time, and length of stay are just a few of the potential impacts of patient sleep disturbance or deprivation [25,28,47].', 'Cardiovascular or other arousals due to noise stressors can also impede patient recovery.', 'As Baker states, “stress results in compensa -\\ntory biological changes, thus redirecting or exhausting resources that might otherwise be available to combat the original disease process” [35].', 'Additional research is needed to determine the chronic implications of noise on patient health.', 'Very few studies examine the entire research chain \\n(acoustic metrics to mechanism to outcome).', 'Thus, the conclusions drawn by the authors in this paper are limited due to concerns such as subject population, lack of detail about acoustic methodologies, the presence of some conflicting results, and limited number of publica -\\ntions on some topics.', 'Regardless, this literature review concludes that hospital noise is a serious issue that can negatively affect patient physiology and more research is needed.', 'The ultimate goal should be to identify ways to improve \\nthe acoustic environment but generally only rudimentary measures (dBA) have been reported.', 'Additionally, a number of “mechanism” studies evaluating changes in the acoustic environment are needed in order to optimize the effectiveness of acoustic or be -\\nhavioral alterations.', 'Already, the use of absorptive ceiling tiles has been shown to positively impact patients.', 'With a better understanding of how interventions impact the acoustics and therefore occupant outcomes, strides can be made in filling the holes in the research chain and providing a healthier atmosphere for patients, staff, and visitors.', '7

      "ABSTRACT\n",
      "Global increases in environmental noise levels – arising from expansion of human populations, transportation networks,\n",
      "and resource extraction – have catalysed a recent surge of research into the effects of noise on wildlife. Synthesising acoherent understanding of the biological consequences of noise from this literature is challenging. Taxonomic groupsvary in auditory capabilities. A wide range of noise sources and exposure levels occur, and many kinds of biologicalresponses have been observed, ranging from individual behaviours to changes in ecological communities. Also, noiseis one of several environmental effects generated by human activities, so researchers must contend with potentiallyconfounding explanations for biological responses. Nonetheless, it is clear that noise presents diverse threats to speciesand ecosystems and salient patterns are emerging to help inform future natural resource-management decisions. We\n",
      "conducted a systematic and standardised review of the scientiﬁc literature published from 1990 to 2013 on the effects\n",
      "of anthropogenic noise on wildlife, including both terrestrial and aquatic studies. Research to date has concentratedpredominantly on European and North American species that rely on vocal communication, with approximatelytwo-thirds of the data set focussing on songbirds and marine mammals. The majority of studies documented effectsfrom noise, including altered vocal behaviour to mitigate masking, reduced abundance in noisy habitats, changesin vigilance and foraging behaviour, and impacts on individual ﬁtness and the structure of ecological communities.This literature survey shows that terrestrial wildlife responses begin at noise levels of approximately 40 dBA, and20% of papers documented impacts below 50 dBA. Our analysis highlights the utility of existing scientiﬁc informationconcerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife for predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure andimplementing meaningful mitigation measures. Future research directions that would support more comprehensivepredictions regarding the magnitude and severity of noise impacts include: broadening taxonomic and geographicalscope, exploring interacting stressors, conducting larger-scale studies, testing mitigation approaches, standardisingreporting of acoustic metrics, and assessing the biological response to noise-source removal or mitigation. The broadvolume of existing information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife offers a valuable resource toassist scientists, industry, and natural-resource managers in predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure.\n",

      "I. INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Noise generated by human activities has increased\n",
      "dramatically over recent decades as a result of population\n",
      "growth, urbanisation, globalisation of transportationnetworks, and expansion of resource extraction. Road trafﬁc\n",
      "in the USA, for example, has outstripped population growth\n",
      "over the past 40 years by a factor of ten, and the number\n",
      "of domestic passenger ﬂights has more than tripled since\n",
      "the early 1980s (Barber, Crooks & Fristrup, 2010). In\n",
      "marine environments, the distribution and effects of human\n",
      "activity (e.g. offshore oil extraction, commercial ship trafﬁc)\n",
      "are extensive (Halpern et al., 2008), and shipping alone\n",
      "is estimated to have increased low-frequency backgroundsound levels by 12 dB over the past few decades (Hildebrand,\n",
      "2009). With the rapid escalation of noise pollution, there\n",
      "is growing concern regarding its impacts on human health\n",
      "and the functioning of natural systems (Chepesiuk, 2005;\n",
      "McGregor et al., 2013).\n",
      "Anthropogenic changes to the acoustic environment\n",
      "include increases in the number of high-intensity noise eventsand chronically elevated and homogenised background\n",
      "sound levels. The impact of these changes has been most\n",
      "thoroughly assessed in humans, with profound physiological\n",
      "and psychological consequences, including increased risk of\n",
      "cardiovascular disease (Babisch et al., 2005; Hansell et al.,\n",
      "2013), sleep deprivation (Fyhri & Aasvang, 2010), and\n",
      "cognitive impairment (Szalma & Hancock, 2011). Theseimpacts are estimated to cost at least one million healthy\n",
      "life years per annum in Western Europe (Fritschi et al.,\n",
      "2011). Protective legislation for human communities was\n",
      "implemented four decades ago in the USA (Noise Control Act\n",
      "of 1972, Quiet Communities Act of 1978) and more recentlyin the European Union (Environmental Noise Directive\n",
      "2002/49/EC).\n",
      "Quantifying the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife\n",
      "is challenging. Sensitivity to noise varies widely across taxa(Kaseloo & Tyson, 2004; Brumm & Slabbekoorn, 2005;Morley, Jones & Radford, 2013; Slabbekoorn, 2013), andmay also vary depending upon context, sex, and life history(Ellison et al., 2012; Francis & Barber, 2013). Noise can induce\n",
      "compound biological responses (e.g. shifts in vocalisationand movement; McLaughlin & Kunc, 2013), and is rarely\n",
      "isolated from other forms of environmental disturbance, such\n",
      "as habitat alteration and visual disturbance, confoundinginterpretation of biological responses to noisy environments(Summers, Cunnington & Fahrig, 2011). Furthermore,determining the scale and extent of disturbance involvescarefully measuring characteristics of the sound source, suchas duration (chronic, intermittent), frequency content, andintensity (Nowacek et al., 2007; Southall et al., 2007; Francis\n",
      "& Barber, 2013; Gill et al., 2015).\n",
      "Despite these challenges, a coherent research focus on\n",
      "noise impacts has recently emerged. Review papers haveeither focussed broadly on wildlife (Brumm & Slabbekoorn,2005; Barber et al., 2010; Kight & Swaddle, 2011), or\n",
      "targeted speciﬁc taxonomic groups such as birds (Patricelli& Blickley, 2006; Slabbekoorn & Ripmeester, 2008; Ortega,2012; Slabbekoorn, 2013), ﬁsh (Slabbekoorn et al., 2010;\n",
      "Radford, Kerridge & Simpson, 2014), and invertebrates(Morley et al., 2013). The Marine Mammal Protection Act\n",
      "stimulated noise regulation for marine mammals, and there\n",
      "have been several reviews of the effects of noise on thesespecies (Richardson et al., 1995; Boyd et al., 2008; Tyack,\n",
      "2008; Southall et al., 2009; Ellison et al., 2012). Some reviews\n",
      "have focused on speciﬁc behaviours (Luther & Gentry, 2013)or responses to noise (Wright et al., 2007; Hotchkin & Parks,\n",

      "regardless of whether the noise was intentionally produced,such as seismic exploration, sonars, acoustic deterrents, or anunintended by-product of human activity such as maritimeshipping, trafﬁc corridors, and construction. Furthermore,we categorised noise sources based on anthropogenic activity,not necessarily the characteristics of the noise stimulus,although we also recorded and present this information(see online Appendix S1).

      "Studies were assigned to the environmental noise category\n",
      "when the noise investigated was not attributed to a speciﬁcsource, but rather included all the acoustic energy generatedby human activity at a given location and time, alsoknown as urban noise or background noise. In many cases,these acoustic environments include sources from the otherdeﬁned noise categories that were not identiﬁed in theexperimental design. Noise sources in the transportationcategory comprised both commercial and private vehicles,including road trafﬁc (motorcycles, automobiles, buses),waterway trafﬁc (boats, ferries, commercial ships), andnon-military aerial trafﬁc (commercial jets, helicopters).\n",
      "Studies that investigated speciﬁc recreational activities, such\n",
      "as whale-watching boats and air tour helicopters, wereseparated from the transportation studies. The industrialnoise source category included studies that examinedthe effects of energy exploration (e.g. seismic surveys),construction (e.g. pile driving), and the operations associatedwith different energy sectors. Military sources includedgunﬁre, explosions, aircraft, naval sonar, and in somecases, entire military training operations. We categorisedthe remainder of the studies as ‘other’, with most studies inthis category using a simulated noise source, such as whitenoise, and not representing a speciﬁc human activity.\n",

      "of acoustic environments, signals or stimuli, was provided.Information was collected on the acoustic metrics reported,where the reported level was measured (i.e. on site, on animal,not reported, estimated), and if background sound levelswere measured.

      "Our review has highlighted the substantial body of\n",
      "information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on\n",
      "wildlife. Such research can assist scientists, natural resource\n",
      "managers, industry, and policy makers in both predictingpotential outcomes of noise exposure as well as implementing\n",
      "meaningful thresholds and mitigation measures. Reﬁnement\n",
      "and focus on several key research areas will further strengthenthe conclusions and inferences that can be drawn regarding\n",
      "the impacts of noise on wildlife.(1) Expand geographic and taxonomic sampling\n",
      "Research on the effects of anthropogenic noise on terrestrial\n",
      "systems has been taxonomically and geographically biased,\n",
      "with 65% of studies conducted on birds and marine mammals\n",
      "and 81% of research carried out in either North Americaor Europe (includes all theoretical and laboratory-based\n",
      "studies). Investigating the effects of noise across a broader\n",
      "array of species and habitats is crucial for developingtheories that explain variations in response to noise in\n",
      "terms of unique auditory capabilities, social structure, life\n",
      "history, ecological role, and evolutionary adaptation. Greater\n",
      "knowledge of taxon-level responses to noise will also be useful\n",
      "in predicting the likely responses of species that are too rareor elusive to study directly and may reveal responses in\n",
      "species previously thought unaffected because they occupy\n",
      "noisy areas (Shannon et al., 2014) or have peak hearing\n",
      "sensitivities outside of a particular noise source (Goldbogen\n",
      "et al., 2013).\n",
      "(2) Explore interacting effects\n",
      "In most cases, it remains unclear whether responses to noise\n",
      "will be further compounded by the introduction of potentiallyheterotypic stressors such as artiﬁcial light and habitat\n",

      "Documenting biological responses in environments that have\n",
      "experienced a reduction in noise, such as closure of a road,\n",
      "closure of an energy facility, or a change in ship trafﬁc routes,\n",

      "reduction in noise levels.\n",
      "(4) Invest in large-scale studies\n",
      "To date there are very few studies that have attempted to\n",
      "explore the effects of noise at the landscape scale and/or\n",
      "over long temporal periods (e.g. seasonal, yearly), likely due\n",
      "to the logistical and experimental challenges that it presents,particularly in isolating the effects of noise from other sources\n",

      "(5) Measure responses over a gradient of noise\n",
      "levels\n",
      "Additional studies are needed that investigate a gradient of\n",
      "noise exposure rather than quiet versus loud treatments. A\n",
      "gradient design provides insight on the levels of noise at\n",
      "which a response is initiated and how the response changes\n",
      "with increasing noise levels. This design can also reveal howanimals recover from exposure to noise, while exploring the\n",
      "relationship between levels and duration of noise exposure\n",
      "and habituation or sensitisation by different species.\n",
      "(6) Evaluate mitigation measures\n",
      "There is a need to evaluate the ecological beneﬁt of mitigation\n",
      "measures in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.\n",
      "Technological innovations (such as quieter ship propellers,car and aeroplane engines, tyres, and asphalt), modiﬁcations\n",
      "to standard operations (e.g. slower ship and vehicle\n",
      "speeds, trafﬁc ﬂow control, road closures), and sound\n",
      "barriers can signiﬁcantly reduce noise levels in a particular\n",
      "habitat; however the beneﬁts to wildlife are not fullyunderstood. For example, how long does a road need\n",
      "to be closed for the biological community to recover\n",
      "from trafﬁc noise? Do the unintended consequences of\n",
      "sound barriers (e.g. fragmentation or acoustically reﬂective\n",
      "surfaces) outweigh the beneﬁts (Parris & Schneider, 2009)?Further, design and implementation of mitigation methods\n",
      "should match the timing and locations of biological\n",
      "activity, particularly during biologically sensitive periods,such as breeding (e.g. lekking behaviour in sage grouse\n",
      "Centrocercus urophasianus ; Blickley et al., 2012 a,b)o rs e a s o n a l\n",
      "movement (e.g. spring migration in cetaceans; Patenaude\n",
      "et al., 2002).\n",
      "(7) Improve reporting of acoustic metrics\n",
      "Identifying the conditions that elicit biological responses is\n",
      "impossible without exposure information. Relevant detailsshould include speciﬁcation of acoustic metrics, temporal\n",
      "characteristics of the measurement (duration of recordings),\n",
      "frequency range measured, weighting ﬁlters applied, and the\n",
      "reference pressure used. Additionally, recording equipment\n",
      "and measurement procedures (distances and duration) shouldbe documented for the source and received levels. Spectral\n",
      "descriptions or graphics provide important detail on the\n",
      "dominant frequencies of the noise source and can be\n",
      "compared to the hearing sensitivities of different species. The\n",
      "current state of the literature limits proper meta-analyticalapproaches that would allow compilation, comparison, and\n",
      "projection.\n",
      "VI. CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "(1) The substantial body of scientiﬁc research reviewed\n",
      "here provides considerable evidence that anthropogenic\n",
      "noise is detrimental to wildlife and natural ecosystems.(2) Expertise from a diverse range of disciplines is required\n",
      "to improve understanding of the impacts associated with\n",
      "noise, especially considering that the effects may be expressed\n",
      "from the cellular to the ecosystem level.\n",
      "(3) It is essential that research on the effects of\n",
      "anthropogenic noise evolves to report acoustic metrics\n",
      "accurately, test gradients of noise exposure, measurelong-term consequences of responses to noise, assesscumulative effects of disturbance, investigate effectiveness\n",
      "of mitigation measures and recovery from chronic noise\n",
      "exposure, and ﬁll in gaps with more diverse taxonomicgroups and noise sources.\n",
      "(4) We provide a cumulate weight-of-evidence summary of\n",
      "the recent literature, an initial step in providing guidance fornatural resource managers when evaluating anthropogenic\n",
      "impacts or developing conservation policy.\n",
      "(5) The interface between marine mammal research,\n",
      "regulation, and mitigation regarding noise provides an\n",
      "exemplar for controlling impacts for other taxa and\n",
      "ecosystems (Southall et al., 2007; Stokstad, 2014). While the\n",
      "strides taken in the past decades have been impressive andprovide a solid basis for shaping this critically important\n",
      "ﬁeld of research, future activities should attempt to manage\n",
      "these impacts on temporal and spatial scales relevant towildlife.\n",
